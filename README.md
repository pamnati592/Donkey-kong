Donkey Kong – Unity Remake
Overview

A compact 2D platformer inspired by the classic Donkey Kong. Run, jump, climb ladders, dodge rolling barrels and ghosts, grab a hammer power-up to smash hazards, and reach Pauline to clear the level. Includes main menu, difficulty select, pause, multiple levels, lives, and background music.

Controls

Left / Right — Move

Up / Down — Climb ladders (Down also enters a ladder from the platform edge when the “ladder-under” probe is beneath you)

Space — Jump

Z — Hammer attack (after picking up the hammer)

ESC — Pause / Resume

How to Play

Start Level 1: From the Main Menu press Start Game, go to Select Difficulty, choose High or Low, and the game loads Level 1.

Move across platforms and use ladders to change floors.

Avoid hazards (barrels, fire barrels, ghosts). If a hazard touches you and you’re not actively hitting it with the hammer’s hitbox, you lose a life.

Pick up the hammer to briefly attack with Z and break nearby barrels.

Reach Pauline at the top to complete the level. If you lose all lives you’ll see the losing screen; otherwise you retry or advance.
